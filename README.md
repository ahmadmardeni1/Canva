First of all, you need to choose which category your template is related to. If it is not related to any existing one, then please create a new folder with the category name.

Second, upload your template inside the category folder. Please make sure to follow the numbering structure. For example, if the last template has the name `Template 5` then your template should have the name `Template 6`.

Third, edit the **README.md** file inside that category to match the following example:
